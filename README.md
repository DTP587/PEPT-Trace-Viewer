# PEPT Trace Viewer

PEPT trace viewer written with dash. Very rough state at the moment. Things to add:

-[] Recommended subsampling as a default when file is open.
-[] Dynamic subsampling (subsampling is adjusted on zoom in, only plot points in view).
-[] Fix/remove interpolation option for time series.
